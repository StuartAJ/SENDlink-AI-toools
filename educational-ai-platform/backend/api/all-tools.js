// Custom implementations of educational AI tools
//
// This module provides our own simple implementations of a variety of tools
// inspired by the functionality of SLT AI and TeachMate AI. Each function
// accepts a set of parameters relevant to the task and returns a basic
// object or string demonstrating the type of response that could be
// generated. These implementations are intentionally lightweight and are
// intended as examples that can be extended with real AI models or data.
