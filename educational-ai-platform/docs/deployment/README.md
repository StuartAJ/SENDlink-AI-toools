# Deployment Guide

This guide outlines how to deploy the educational AI platform across development, staging and production environments. Proper deployment ensures that the system remains secure, reliable and scalable.

## Environment setup

1. **Database configuration** – choose a database engine such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Configure connection strings in `backend/config/index.js`. For local development, use an in‑container instance or a managed service.
2. **Environment variables** – store sensitive information (database credentials, JWT secrets, API keys) in environment variables or a secrets manager. Do not commit secrets to the repository.
3. **Node environment** – install Node.js and relevant package managers. Run `npm install` to install dependencies in both the root and `frontend` if the front end is separated.
4. **Build scripts** – create build scripts for the front end (e.g. `npm run build`) and for starting the back end (e.g. `node server.js`). Use environment‑specific builds for development and production.

## Stages of deployment

### Development

Developers work locally or on a shared development server. Enable hot‑reloading and verbose logging. Use dummy data for school profiles and tool outputs. Run tests continuously.

### Staging

Deploy to a staging environment that mirrors production. Use a copy of real data with anonymisation applied. This environment is for user acceptance testing by teachers, subject leaders and senior leaders. Monitor performance and fix issues before promoting to production.

### Production

Deploy the application to a secure, scalable hosting platform (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Configure automatic scaling and backups. Use an API gateway to manage traffic and apply rate limiting. Ensure all communications are over HTTPS.

## Integration testing

Write unit tests for each tool function in `/backend/api`. Use integration tests to verify that endpoints return expected results given sample inputs and that permissions are enforced correctly. The testing suite should also cover user authentication, school data retrieval and error handling.

## Security considerations

* **GDPR compliance** – handle personal data according to GDPR. Obtain consent for data processing, provide data access and deletion rights and ensure cross‑border data transfers conform to UK requirements.
* **Audit logging** – record each API call with user ID, timestamp and summary of input and output. Use logs to investigate suspicious activity and measure tool adoption.
* **Regular updates** – keep dependencies up to date, apply security patches promptly and perform periodic penetration tests.

## Backup and disaster recovery

Implement daily backups of the database and file storage. Store backups in a separate region. Test restoration procedures regularly. Establish an incident response plan detailing roles, responsibilities and communication channels in case of outages or data breaches.
